# Frontend Setup for Roxiler MERN Stack Challenge

## Prerequisites

Before running the frontend, make sure the Node.js server is up and running. Follow the instructions in the backend repository's `README.md` to start the server first.

## Getting Started

To set up and run the frontend application, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mrunal-Yechakar/roxiler-mern-stack-challenge.git

   
2. **Navigate to the Frontend Directory**

   Change into the frontend directory:

   ```bash
   cd roxiler-mern-stack-challenge/frontend
   
3. **Install Dependencies**

   Install the required npm packages:

   ```bash
   npm install

4. **Start the Development Server**

   Start the frontend development server:

   ```bash
   npm start

The development server will start, and the frontend application will be accessible at 
### http://localhost:3000

## Notes
- Ensure the Node.js server is running before starting the frontend. The frontend application relies on the backend server for API calls and other functionalities.
- If you encounter any issues or errors, check the terminal logs for details and consult the project documentation.
